As a result, the system appears to behave in an unpredictable way and may exhibit seemingly random fluctuations (chaotic behavior).

The apparatus was then turned through 90° and the two interference patterns were compared to see if there had been a shift of the fringes. If light has a velocity relative to the ether and there is an ether ‘wind’ as the Earth moves through space, then the times of travel of the two beams would change, resulting in a fringe shift. No such shift was detected, not even when the experiment was repeated six months later when the ether wind would have reversed direction.');

Information is transmitted in this way. There are several ways in which modulation can be performed. In amplitude modulation the amplitude of the carrier wave rises and falls as the amplitude of the modulating wave rises and falls. If the carrier wave is regarded as a sine wave then amplitude modulation alters the amplitude of the sine wave but does not change the angular aspect of the carrier wave, either as regards phase angle or frequency. Modulation which involves change of the angle is known as angle modulation. There are two types of angle modulation: frequency modulation and phase modulation. In frequency modulation the frequency of the carrier wave rises and falls as the amplitude of the modulating wave rises and falls. In phase modulation the relative phase of the carrier wave changes by an amount proportional to the amplitude of the modulating wave. In angle modulation the amplitude of the carrier wave is not altered. There exist several other types of modulation, including some which make use of pulses (pulse modulation).');

Also, many functions cannot be integrated in terms of known standard integrals. In these cases, numerical integration methods, such as the TRAPEZIUM RULEand SIMPSON’S RULE, can be used to calculate the area under a graph corresponding to the integral. The area is divided into vertical columns of equal width, the width of each column representing an interval between two values of x for which f(x) is known. Usually a calculation is first carried out with a few columns; these are further subdivided until the desired accuracy is attained, i.e. when further subdivision makes no significant difference to the result.');

The bulk modulus is the ratio of the pressure applied to a body to the fraction by which the volume of the body has decreased. The shear modulus, also known as the rigidy is the ratio of the shear force per unit area divided by the deformation of the body, measured in radians. Since these elastic moduli all have ratios of stress to strain they have the dimensions of force per unit area since stresses have the dimensions of force per unit area and strains are dimensionless numbers. The modulus is named for the British physicist and physician Thomas Young (1773– 1829).');
